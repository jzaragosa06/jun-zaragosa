        fullDescription: "This article explores how Google Earth Engine (GEE) can be used to identify natural terrain barriers that function like windbreaks, using wind direction and elevation data. By analyzing elevation from SRTM data and wind direction from ERA5-Land datasets, the method highlights terrain features aligned perpendicularly to prevailing winds. Areas with strong alignment and steep slopes are masked and visualized to pinpoint effective natural wind barriers. Despite its utility, the approach faces limitations due to data resolution, slope/aspect noise, and temporal variability in wind patterns.",

        fullDescription: "This article explores the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to identify natural terrain features that act as wind barriers by analyzing elevation and wind direction data. Using SRTM DEM for elevation and ERA5-Land for wind data, the author computes terrain alignment with wind to highlight areas with strong resistance to wind. The method involves calculating slope, aspect, and cosine similarity between terrain orientation and wind direction to isolate optimal zones. Despite its utility, the approach is limited by the resolution of available datasets and challenges with low-relief terrain and wind variability.",
